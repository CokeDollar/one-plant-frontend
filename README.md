# One Plant Frontend ðŸª´

## About The Project

### Background
One Plant is a Web3 project inspired by [Prometheans](https://prometheans.xyz/). It has a plant that survives for 15 minutes without being watered, and to water the plant a user has to mint an NFT within those 15 minutes. The NFTs minted are all different based on the time the user minted them. The aim of the game is to keep the plant alive for as long as possible. The game uses a pay-what-you-want pricing model which enables users to mint an NFT for free, but if they donate at least 0.02ETH, they will be put on a whitelist for future projects by Coin Plants.
